# Hydrogen Atom
Jupyter notebook for modelling of hydrogen atom for various states using quantum physics. I created this notebook mainly for my Instagram page - Partial Sums. The notebook is not yet finalised but I will regularly post updates and improve the model. I hope you will enjoy. Theory was based my notes from PHAS0023 | Atomic and Molecular Physics at University College London.
